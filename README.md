## Tic Tac Toe Web Application
This project is a web-based Tic Tac Toe game, developed as part of my web development internship at Skillcraft. The application allows two players to play against each other, taking turns to mark 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid.

## Features
Two-Player Game: Allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe on the same device.
Responsive Design: The game adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Winning Detection: Automatically detects and displays the winner or if the game ends in a tie.
Game Reset: Provides an option to reset the game board after each match.
## Technologies Used
HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript 
(for handling the game logic and user interactions)

## Usage
Open the application in any web browser.

Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their marker ('X' or 'O').

The game will announce the winner or declare a tie once the game ends.

Use the "Reset" button to restart the game and play again.
